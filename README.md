# Camera Filters

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate how to apply various image-processing filters to live webcam streams and static images using OpenCV.  
Features include:
- Grayscale conversion  
- Brightness and contrast adjustment  
- Cartoon/quantization effect  
- Watermark overlay  
- And moreâ€¦

Each filter is implemented in a standalone script (`camera_filters.py`, `adjust_brightness.py`, `Grayscale.py`, `watermark.py`) so you can easily mix and match or extend them for your own projects.
